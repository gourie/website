I am a computer scientist in the IT Artificial Intelligence team at UCB Pharma where I work on computer vision problems in the medical imaging domain. 
I am also a second-year PhD student at the [ESAT/PSI department](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi) of the KU Leuven spending two days per week in the [Medical Imaging Research Center](https://mirc.uzleuven.be/MedicalImagingCenter/about.php) at the University Hospitals Leuven.
My current research focuses on incorporating prior knowledge into deep neural networks and out-of-distribution generalization.
